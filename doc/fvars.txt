fvars: FEHM thermodynamic calculations
======================================

It is occasionally useful to be able to calculate thermodynamic properties of the fluids that FEHM simulates. 
For convenience, the functions that calculate these properties, for two-phase water and CO2, are supplied here. Density 
(:func:`~fvars.dens`), enthalpy (:func:`~fvars.enth`) and viscosity (:func:`~fvars.visc`), and their corresponding 
derivatives with respect to pressure and temperature, can be calculated for
given pressure and temperature conditions. Furthermore, the position and derivatives of the saturation line for water
can be calculated for a given temperature or pressure (:func:`~fvars.sat` and :func:`~fvars.tsat`).

Note, these functions are vectorised; that is, the user can supply vectors of temperature and pressure to output a 
vector of the corresponding variable.
