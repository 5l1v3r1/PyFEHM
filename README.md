Python is an open-source, object-oriented scripting language with extensive functionality, a large, active development community and loads of online resources for troubleshooting.

Briefly, PyFEHM functionality includes:

1. Unstructured/structure grid parsing, structured grid generation and manipulation.
2. FEHM input file construction. Support for many macros, restart files, stress and carbon dioxide modules.
3. Post-processing of output, including visualisation in Paraview.
4. Scripting tools that supports Pythonâ€™s built-in multi-processing capabilities for batch simulations.
