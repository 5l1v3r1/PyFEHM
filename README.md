Python is an open-source, object-oriented scripting language with extensive functionality, a large, active development community and loads of online resources for troubleshooting.
PyFEHM is a set of classes and methods to enable use of FEHM and auxiliary tasks within the Python scripting environment.
Briefly, PyFEHM functionality includes:

1. Unstructured/structure grid parsing, structured grid generation and manipulation (see Chapter 2).
2. FEHM input file construction. Support for many macros, restart files, stress and carbon dioxide modules (see Chapter 3).
3. Post-processing of output (see Chapter 4), including visualisation in Paraview.
4. Scripting tools that supports Pythonâ€™s built-in multi-processing capabilities for batch simulations.
